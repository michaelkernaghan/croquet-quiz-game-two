# Advanced Croquet Concepts from MacRobertson Shield 2022

## Triple Peel (TP) Tactics
- Standard TP: A planned sequence to peel partner ball through last three hoops
- Rush-peel: Peeling while rushing the ball (e.g., "Aaron rush-peels 4-b")
- Irish peel: A specific type of peel where both balls go through the hoop together
- Death roll: A risky peeling attempt (mentioned: "Aaron tries the death-roll to 3-b")

## Advanced Shot Types
1. Stop Shot Peel
   - Alternative to Irish peel
   - Used in specific situations near hoops
   - Requires precise control

2. Hampered Shots
   - When striker's shot is impeded by another ball or hoop
   - Often requires referee oversight
   - Example: "Samir is hampered after 4-b - looks tricky"

3. Jump Shots
   - Used when balls are blocking direct path
   - "Needs a floppy half jump"
   - High risk of faulting
