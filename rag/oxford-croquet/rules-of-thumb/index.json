With thought you can manufacture these targets into your break. Even if you do not plan them, recognising when an opportunity exists and taking advantage of it will make your break easier.\n\n'Getting control' of a break means that you can get close to your hoop, therefore dictate where the reception ball is placed behind the hoop and hence obtain a desirable rush after running the hoop. You become the architect of your break. You can choose the position for the next croquet stroke to favour your preferred croquet stroke (e.g. stop-shot or drive) whilst narrowing that stroke's angle and reducing its length. That boosts the success of the shot and is likely to give you control at your next hoop etc.\n\n1.1 Manufacture short strokes\n\nShort strokes are easier to play and more accurate than long ones.\n\nFor example getting a rush out of a hoop to near the pivot shortens the distances to the next pioneer position and the pivot. Another case is where you can rush your pivot closer to the next pioneer. Rather than having, say, a 9-metre take-off you could have a 3-metre take-off. The take-off will be shorter, more accurate and you will get closer to the hoop.\n\n1.2 Use narrow croquet strokes\n\nWide croquet strokes, where the angle between the departing balls is large, are difficult to play and less successful than narrow ones.\n\nTry to get a rush after your hoop to a position where you can play a narrow croquet stroke.\n\n1.3 Approach balls along their rush line or, if close, stop-shot across the rush line\n\nCut rushes are difficult and the smallest deviation in aiming or execution will produce an undesirable result. A near-straight rush is tolerant of minor deviations in aiming. If you approach up a ball's rush line you are unlikely to need a cut rush and additionally if your shot stops short or long of your intended position you still have a straight rush. Playing a stop-shot across a rush line is OK since you have a lot of control on the striker's ball's position in a stop-shot.\n\nTo see these rules in action in a 4-ball break see the animation.\n\n2 Priorities Without Bisques\n\nThese are just common sense, but players are seen frequently playing with the wrong priorities. When playing without bisques in your favour, your priorities are: Hoop, Break then Fancy Stuff.\n\n2.1 Your immediate hoop\n\nThere are no prizes for placing a perfect pioneer at your next hoop if you fail to make your immediate hoop. Sure, gesture a pioneer in your croquet stroke towards a future hoop but all your focus should be on getting through your immediate hoop. Hence prioritise getting the important rush or position. Sometimes it may be worth playing a simple take-off to hoop-running position and worrying about something to hit once you have run the hoop.\n\n2.2 The break\n\nAs above there is no point trying a peel or manufacture a fancy wiring, for instance, if it destroys your break and you grind to an embarrassing halt.\n\n2.3 Fancy stuff\n\nYou should only try fancy stuff, e.g. peeling, if you have full control of the break and can reliably continue it if the manoeuvre fails.\n\n3 General Rules of Thumb\n\nThere are many rules of thumb. There are always exceptions but they are mainly useful.\n\n3.1 Don't join up in the middle of the court\n\nFinish your turn with your side's balls near the edge of the court, not in the middle. If the opponent shoots at your ball and misses their ball will come back on to the court next to you where you can easily hit them. The edges are defensive. If your balls are in the middle of the court, the opponent can shoot through and sail away to the safety of the boundary. Additionally it takes more work for the opponent to get a break started if your balls are at the edge of the court.\n\n3.2 Don't put your pivot near to the peg\n\nA pivot in a 4-ball break which is say within ¼ m of the peg is inaccessible from a large area of the court. Your pivot should be moving within the outer four hoops to make your break easier. There are simple manoeuvres to cope if the pivot is outside those four hoops.\n\n3.3 Never rush a pioneer to your next-but-1 hoop\n\nRushing pioneers to such a position is a sin.\n\nRushing is an imprecise sport - the ball can spray anywhere. Always contrive to croquet pioneers into position. There are very few instances where this cannot be achieved. When you croquet, the path of the forward ball is precisely defined. If you are trying to start a break or peeling then you may be forced to commit this crime. Such a heinous rush is frequently followed by a long difficult take-off.\n\n3.4 Don't run hoops to length\n\nUnless you are very close to a hoop or extremely accurate then attempting to run a hoop to a precise length is a dangerous occupation. There are no prizes for sticking in a hoop; leave running hoops to length to the experts. So run the hoop confidently, rush the reception ball if it is useful, otherwise roll to keep the break going. It is wise to put your reception ball deeper to allow you run the hoop with pace yet still obtain a rush.\n\n3.5 Avoid very fine cut rushes\n\nVery fine cut rushes are very, very difficult. If they go wrong it is normally disastrous or terminal; you either miss or belt the roqueted ball in totally the wrong direction. Is it really worth risking breaking down to shift that ball at most 1 m?\n\n3.6 Two balls together equals a rush anywhere\n\nIf you roquet a ball and take-off (etc.) to a pair of balls, you can roquet one and, from a short distance, get a perfect rush on the other to anywhere on the court. This can occur at the start of a turn where the opponent has joined up, or be contrived. If you have a weak pioneer for a hoop, the pivot can be sent to join it. Then after running your current hoop you can then put a pioneer to your next-but-one hoop whilst going to the pair of balls and gain a rush to your next hoop as detailed above.\n\n3.7 Avoid joining up if the opponent is joined up\n\nThis gives the opponent a very accurate rush to anywhere on the lawn (see above). They hit partner, take-off to your pair of balls and roquet one. They then have a short take-off to get a perfect rush on the other. A wide join can be an appropriate leave if the opponent is joined up. If they roquet one of your balls then the other ball is sufficiently far away that their likelihood of getting an accurate rush is reduced. The join is not so wide so you threaten to hit in if they leave you alone.\n\n3.8 It is viable to join up very close together on the yardline\n\nThis works whether the opponent is joined up or not. If you set a rush with the back ball on the yardline and the front very close (say 15 cm, but not leaving a double target), then it is likely that the opponent will only get one of your balls into play and leave the other very near the yardline. They will get a rush to anywhere on the lawn however. Best join up far from the hoops they want.\n\n3.9 Avoid joining up across a corner\n\nIf you, say, place one ball 2 m north of corner 1 and the other 2 m east of it then you will frustrate an opponent's take-off to one of your balls and getting an easy rush on the other. But what happens if you are left there and it is your turn? If you shoot at partner you will have your two balls adjacent to each other, which can be weak. Better to create a wide join on the same boundary and be able to leap-frog your partner if you miss, leaving another wide join.\n\n3.10 Don't join up near your opponent's hoops\n\nIf your opponent successfully hits another ball, then balls by their hoop firstly gives them the hoop and, secondly, the subsequent continuation stroke and possible rush can let them start building a break. Better, join up remote from their hoops so they will have a long rush to their hoop. Rushing is an imprecise sport!\n\n3.11 If you have a poor pioneer at your next hoop send the pivot close to that pioneer\n\nIf you are able to position your pivot close to the bad pioneer - this creates \"two ball together\" (see 3.6). Subsequently if you can hit either and there is a short take-off to get an accurate rush to the hoop on the other.\n\n3.12 Don't rush a third ball to two balls\n\nEspecially at the edge of the court, if you rush a ball to where two others are waiting you will have a problem. If three balls are together you are probably only going to rush one of them out of the group. You will take-off to one of the pair and then get a perfect rush on the other. But you will be leaving two balls together behind you.\n\n3.13 Plan your leave three hoops before the end of your break\n\nThis gives you time to get balls in place and permute the colours so that you can achieve your desired leave. Hence if going to peg start thinking about your leave at 4-back, or at 1-back if you are stopping after 3-back (Advanced Rules).\n\n3.14 Avoid making your last hoop off partner ball\n\nThat is, don't roquet partner first after running the last hoop. This is desirable, but not mandatory. If the first ball you hit after your last hoop is partner, you will have to position it for your leave then attempt to position the opposition balls. If something goes wrong with their positions you have no chance of adjusting partner's position. If you hit an opponent ball first after your last hoop then position it and then the other opponent ball, you can finally rush your partner to a tidy position, e.g. wired from one of the opponents, or creating a single ball target.\n\n3.15 Keep balls together when laying up for a leave\n\nMost leaves finish with you setting a rush for one of your side's balls. You may also wish to leave a single-ball target to one of the enemy balls. For this to be accurate and successful roll the balls, close together, to almost their final positions. It then requires a very short stroke to position your striker's ball accurately. If you stop-shot partner ball towards the yard line and then play your striker's ball to join it, there is little hope of accuracy.\n\n3.16 Peg out with a drive, not a roll shot, if possible\n\nIn pegging out you want the croqueted ball to travel straight and not be jostled by the striker's ball or a slow ball veer off course due to gradients. Consequently play a firm straight-ish drive or stop-shot shot. With a split roll 'pull' may come into effect and needs to be allowed for.\n\n3.17 Avoid split rolls for peeling\n\nRoll shots, especially at ~45°, have pull, where the trajectory of (at least) the croqueted ball moves in towards the aiming line of the stroke. The amount of pull depends on many factors and its magnitude is ultimately a guess. Consequently peels with wide roll shots are unpredictable. If possible peel using a drive, stop-shot or narrow roll.\n\n3.18 Use a 'pivot swap' where your reception ball and pivot are close together\n\nIf, once you have roqueted your reception ball, there is not enough space to play a stroke to place the next pioneer without over-taking your pivot, it is worth swapping pivot. Make your reception ball the new pivot and rush the old pivot to a 3-ball break position. This is normally close to your next pioneer giving the ability to stop-shot a pioneer to your next-but-one hoop whilst approaching the immediate pioneer along its rush line.\n\nGetting a good rush on the pivot towards your next pioneer makes getting the next hoop more certain. As mentioned before (2.1), a good pioneer on your next hoop or next-plus-one is useless unless you make the immediate hoop.\n\n3.19 Under Advanced Rules, consider a pivot swap after hoop 5 with your first ball\n\nAs mentioned above it is undesirable to make 3-back (your last hoop unless you wish to concede a contact) off your partner ball if you are making an Advanced Leave. Assuming a 4-ball break, the pioneer at 1-back becomes the pioneer at 3-back, hence after hoop 5 it is nice to send an enemy ball as a pioneer to 1-back. This could require a pivot swap which is easy, given the short distances between hoops 5 and 6.\n\n3.20 Under Advanced Rules, avoid an advanced pioneer on 2-back\n\nExpert players sometimes place a pioneer on 2-back after hoop 5 and make hoops 6 and 1-back with a 3-ball break. Non-experts emulate this and end up making their break fragile. Stay with a 4-ball break which is much more forgiving and less likely to fail. Unless you know the full reasoning and mechanism for placing this pioneer, avoid it.\n\nAuthor: Dr Ian Plummer\nAll rights reserved © 2022-2024\n\n\nUpdated 25.xii.24\nAbout, Webmaster\t\nwww.oxfordcroquet.com/coach/thumb/index.asp\non www.oxfordcroquet.com\n\t\nHits: 3768\n\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFront Page\nWhat's New\nHow to Play\nEquipment\nLaws\nRefereeing\nRankings\nTournaments\nTechnical\nLawn Care\nCroquet Clubs\nClub Management\nHealth & Safety\nPromoting Croquet\nHistory\nContacts & Links\nFAQ\nMiscellany\nAdverts",

With thought you can manufacture these targets into your break. Even if you do not plan them, recognising when an opportunity exists and taking advantage of it will make your break easier.\n      'Getting control' of a break means that you can get close to your hoop, therefore dictate where the reception ball is placed behind the hoop and hence obtain a desirable rush after running the hoop. You become the architect of your break. You can choose the position for the next croquet stroke to favour your preferred croquet stroke (e.g. stop-shot or drive) whilst narrowing that stroke's angle and reducing its length. That boosts the success of the shot and is likely to give you control at your next hoop etc.\n        1.1 Manufacture short strokes \n      Short strokes are easier to play and more accurate than long ones.\n      For example getting a rush out of a hoop to near the pivot shortens the distances to the next pioneer position and the pivot. Another case is where you can rush your pivot closer to the next pioneer. Rather than having, say, a 9-metre take-off you could have a 3-metre take-off. The take-off will be shorter, more accurate and you will get closer to the hoop.\n        1.2 Use narrow croquet strokes \n      Wide croquet strokes, where the angle between the departing balls is large, are difficult to play and less successful than narrow ones.\n      Try to get a rush after your hoop to a position where you can play a narrow croquet stroke.\n       1.3 Approach balls along their rush line or, if close, stop-shot across the rush line \n      Cut rushes are difficult and the smallest deviation in aiming or execution will produce an undesirable result. A near-straight rush is tolerant of minor deviations in aiming. If you approach up a ball's rush line you are unlikely to need a cut rush and additionally if your shot stops short or long of your intended position you still have a straight rush. Playing a stop-shot across a rush line is OK since you have a lot of control on the striker's ball's position in a stop-shot.\n      To see these rules in action in a 4-ball break see the animation.\n        2 Priorities Without Bisques\n      These are just common sense, but players are seen frequently playing with the wrong priorities. When playing without bisques in your favour, your priorities are: Hoop, Break then Fancy Stuff.\n      2.1 Your immediate hoop\n      There are no prizes for placing a perfect pioneer at your next hoop if you fail to make your immediate hoop. Sure, gesture a pioneer in your croquet stroke towards a future hoop but all your focus should be on getting through your immediate hoop. Hence prioritise getting the important rush or position. Sometimes it may be worth playing a simple take-off to hoop-running position and worrying about something to hit once you have run the hoop.\n      2.2 The break\n      As above there is no point trying a peel or manufacture a fancy wiring, for instance, if it destroys your break and you grind to an embarrassing halt.\n      2.3 Fancy stuff\n      You should only try fancy stuff, e.g. peeling, if you have full control of the break and can reliably continue it if the manoeuvre fails.\n       3 General Rules of Thumb\n      There are many rules of thumb. There are always exceptions but they are mainly useful.\n      3.1 Don't join up in the middle of the court\n      Finish your turn with your side's balls near the edge of the court, not in the middle. If the opponent shoots at your ball and misses their ball will come back on to the court next to you where you can easily hit them. The edges are defensive. If your balls are in the middle of the court, the opponent can shoot through and sail away to the safety of the boundary. Additionally it takes more work for the opponent to get a break started if your balls are at the edge of the court.\n        3.2 Don't put your pivot near to the peg\n      A pivot in a 4-ball break which is say within ¼ m of the peg is inaccessible from a large area of the court. Your pivot should be moving within the outer four hoops to make your break easier. There are simple manoeuvres to cope if the pivot is outside those four hoops.\n        3.3 Never rush a pioneer to your next-but-1 hoop \n      Rushing pioneers to such a position is a sin.\n      Rushing is an imprecise sport - the ball can spray anywhere. Always contrive to croquet pioneers into position. There are very few instances where this cannot be achieved. When you croquet, the path of the forward ball is precisely defined. If you are trying to start a break or peeling then you may be forced to commit this crime. Such a heinous rush is frequently followed by a  long difficult take-off.\n       3.4 Don't run hoops to length \n      Unless you are very close to a hoop or extremely accurate then attempting to run a hoop to a precise length is a dangerous occupation. There are no prizes for sticking in a hoop; leave running hoops to length to the experts. So run the hoop confidently, rush the reception ball if it is useful, otherwise roll to keep the break going. It is wise to put your reception ball deeper to allow you run the hoop with pace yet still obtain a rush.\n      3.5 Avoid very fine cut rushes\n      Very fine cut rushes are very, very difficult. If they go wrong it is normally disastrous or terminal; you either miss or belt the roqueted ball in totally the wrong direction. Is it really worth risking breaking down to shift that ball at most 1 m?\n      3.6 Two balls together equals a rush anywhere\n      If you roquet a ball and take-off (etc.) to a pair of balls, you can roquet one and, from a short distance, get a perfect rush on the other to anywhere on the court. This can occur at the start of a turn where the opponent has joined up, or be contrived. If you have a weak pioneer for a hoop, the pivot can be sent to join it. Then after running your current hoop you can then put a pioneer to your next-but-one hoop whilst going to the pair of balls and gain a rush to your next hoop as detailed above.\n      3.7 Avoid joining up if the opponent is joined up\n      This gives the opponent a very accurate rush to anywhere on the lawn (see above). They hit partner, take-off to your pair of balls and roquet one. They then have a short take-off to get a perfect rush on the other. A wide join can be an appropriate leave if the opponent is joined up. If they roquet one of your balls then the other ball is sufficiently far away that their likelihood of getting an accurate rush is reduced. The join is not so wide so you  threaten to hit in if they leave you alone.\n      3.8 It is viable to join up very close together on the yardline\n      This works whether the opponent is joined up or not. If you set a rush with the back ball on the yardline and the front very close (say 15 cm, but not leaving a double target), then it is likely that the opponent will only get one of your balls into play and leave the other very near the yardline. They will get a rush to anywhere on the lawn however. Best join up far from the hoops they want. \n      3.9 Avoid joining up across a corner\n      If you, say, place one ball 2 m north of corner 1 and the other 2 m east of it then you will frustrate an opponent's take-off to one of your balls and getting an easy rush on the other. But what happens if you are left there and it is your turn? If you shoot at partner you will have your two balls adjacent to each other, which can be weak. Better to create a wide join on the same boundary and be able to leap-frog your partner if you miss, leaving another wide join.\n      3.10 Don't join up near your opponent's hoops\n      If your opponent successfully hits another ball, then balls by their hoop firstly gives them the hoop and, secondly, the subsequent continuation stroke and possible rush can let them start building a break. Better, join up remote from their hoops so they will have a long rush to their hoop. Rushing is an imprecise sport!\n       3.11 If you have a poor pioneer at your next hoop send the pivot close to that pioneer \n      If you are able to position your pivot close to the bad pioneer - this creates \"two ball together\" (see 3.6). Subsequently if you can hit either and there is a short take-off to get an accurate rush to the hoop on the other.\n      3.12 Don't rush a third ball to two balls\n      Especially at the edge of the court, if you rush a ball to where two others are waiting you will have a problem. If three balls are together you are probably only going to rush one of them out of the group. You will take-off to one of the pair and then get a perfect rush on the other. But you will be leaving two balls together behind you.\n       3.13 Plan your leave three hoops before the end of your break \n      This gives you time to get balls in place and permute the colours so that you can achieve your desired leave. Hence if going to peg start thinking about your leave at 4-back, or at 1-back if you are stopping after 3-back (Advanced Rules).\n       3.14 Avoid making your last hoop off partner ball \n      That is, don't roquet partner first after running the last hoop. This is desirable, but not mandatory. If the first ball you hit after your last hoop is partner, you will have to position it for your leave then attempt to position the opposition balls. If something goes wrong with their positions you have no chance of adjusting partner's position. If you hit an opponent ball first after your last hoop then position it and then the other opponent ball, you can finally rush your partner to a tidy position, e.g. wired from one of the opponents, or creating a single ball target.\n      3.15 Keep balls together when laying up for a leave\n      Most leaves finish with you setting a rush for one of your side's balls. You may also wish to leave a single-ball target to one of the enemy balls. For this to be accurate and successful roll the balls, close together, to almost their final positions. It then requires a very short stroke to position your striker's ball accurately. If you stop-shot partner ball towards the yard line and then play your striker's ball to join it, there is little hope of accuracy.\n       3.16 Peg out with a drive, not a roll shot, if possible \n      In pegging out you want the croqueted ball to travel straight and not be jostled by the striker's ball or a slow ball veer off course due to gradients. Consequently play a firm straight-ish drive or stop-shot shot. With a split roll 'pull' may come into effect and needs to be allowed for.\n      3.17 Avoid split rolls for peeling\n      Roll shots, especially at ~45°, have pull, where the trajectory of (at least) the croqueted ball moves in towards the aiming line of the stroke. The amount of pull depends on many factors and its magnitude is ultimately a guess. Consequently peels with wide roll shots are unpredictable. If possible peel using a drive, stop-shot or narrow roll.\n       3.18 Use a 'pivot swap' where your reception ball and pivot are close together \n      If, once you have roqueted your reception ball, there is not enough space to play a stroke to place the next pioneer without over-taking your pivot, it is worth swapping pivot. Make your reception ball the new pivot and rush the old pivot to a 3-ball break position. This is normally close to your next pioneer giving the ability to stop-shot a pioneer to your next-but-one hoop whilst approaching the immediate pioneer along its rush line.\n      Getting a good rush on the pivot towards your next pioneer makes getting the next hoop more certain. As mentioned before (2.1), a good pioneer on your next hoop or next-plus-one is useless unless you make the immediate hoop.\n      3.19 Under Advanced Rules, consider a pivot swap after hoop 5 with your first ball\n      As mentioned above it is undesirable to make 3-back (your last hoop unless you wish to concede a contact) off your partner ball if you are making an Advanced Leave. Assuming a 4-ball break, the pioneer at 1-back becomes the pioneer at 3-back, hence after hoop 5 it is nice to send an enemy ball as a pioneer to 1-back. This could require a pivot swap which is easy, given the short distances between hoops 5 and 6.\n       3.20 Under Advanced Rules, avoid an advanced pioneer on 2-back \n      Expert players sometimes place a pioneer on 2-back after hoop 5 and make hoops 6 and 1-back with a 3-ball break. Non-experts emulate this and end up making their break fragile. Stay with a 4-ball break which is much more forgiving and less likely to fail. Unless you know the full reasoning and mechanism for placing this pioneer, avoid it.\n\n      \n      Author:  Dr Ian Plummer \n      All rights reserved © 2022-2024 \n      \n      \n\n\n  \n    \n      Updated 25.xii.24\n      \n      About, Webmaster\n    \n        www.oxfordcroquet.com/coach/thumb/index.asp\n        \n        on www.oxfordcroquet.com\n    Hits: 3768",
