There is little on this site or elsewhere* on consolidating your position or inhibiting the opponent's options and opportunities, or both.\n\nYour target is to make it difficult and/or expensive for the opponent to play certain shots; you try to dictate their play. When it is your turn and you do not have the innings, you need to weigh up the gains and risks of each shot you could take. If you miss that shot are you giving them an easy 4-ball break? Should you not take the shot but play a strategic safety shot to a beneficial point on the boundary and wait for later opportunities?\n\nIn the last century players were much more defensive, for example shooting off into corners ('finessing') or leaving wired rushes at the end of a turn. I recall being told \"a good leave is worth a break\". With improved lawns and equipment, however, a ball in a corner is little challenge to an expert player.\n\nNaturally, with any list of rules there are always exceptions. And bisques stir things up!\n\n* As an example the CA's Manual for Coaches only discusses defensive openings. Wylie's Expert Croquet Tactics and the recent Beyond Expert Croquet Tactics (buy) predominately consider Advanced leaves.\n\nGains and Risks\n\nIn croquet there is a constant balance between gains and risks - how likely am I to hit, what do I gain if I hit and what do I give away if I miss? The same applies when considering the opponent: how have they been playing, what is their hitting distance, are they good at long take-offs or rushing? Additionally bisques come into the reckoning.\n\nCan you attempt a manoeuvre but still have a safe retreat path if it does not work?\n\nIt goes without saying that you should avoid 'weak manoeuvres', e.g. joining up by the opponent's hoop or in the middle of the lawn. These are covered in an accompanying article, \"Rules of Thumb\".\n\nDefence During Play\n\nThe examples below apply mainly to the start of and during your turn. What to do at the end is considered in the next section.\n\nHalf Measures are Seldom Effective\n\nSay you have no safe shot at any of the other balls on the lawn, and you want to 'bury' a ball so that it is of no use to the opponent, be defensive. Get the ball well out of play on the boundary likely near a corner and behind their break so it is difficult to winkle out. When being defensive - be defensive!\n\nShooting Through to the Boundary\n\nWhen attempting to hit-in at an in-court ball ensure that your ball will reach the boundary behind it. Boundaries are defensive - if you are near a boundary, an opponent gives a lot away if they shoot at you and miss. Additionally it is much more difficult getting any sort of rush on that ball and hence it is more difficult for the opponent to build a break easily.\n\nPlaying Behind their Break\n\nBehind their break means that, say the opposition is on hoop two then near corner one is behind their break. Generally you pick up boundary balls and incorporate them into a break as you pass them. For example you would pick up a ball in corner 1 before hoop 5. By playing behind the break you delay the pick up causing them to play at most a 3-ball break for a number of hoops.\n\nClearly there are times when the opponent's clip positions limit the options.\n\nAt the start of a turn, you should consider shots where your ball would end up behind the opponent's break (not necessarily aiming at another ball). In other circumstances you would factor where a ball would end up if you shoot at an in-court ball. If there is a choice, all things being equal, the shot where a miss deposits your ball behind their break has an advantage.\n\nShoot Outside the Corner\n\nBurying a ball in a corner is generally safe against players with a handicap greater than ~6. Against better to elite players there is a risk of them getting a cannon. A 3-ball cannon usefully gets all the balls into the lawn and, hopefully, a break started. It is relatively easy to get a corner cannon since a ball rushed anywhere between the corner pegs, a wide target (1.29 m or 51\"), comes back in contact with the corner ball and a 3-ball group is made.\n\nWhen playing against good players it can be prudent to aim just outside the corner to prevent an easy opportunity to make a cannon. Conversely giving a weak player a cannon is likely to result in opportunities for you when it fails.\n\nDo You Want to Take Partner into Lawn?\n\nIf there is a poor chance of getting a break going it can be imprudent to rush your partner fully into the court. It may end up exposed, where the opponent has a safe shot through it to the safety of a boundary. It may be better to bring it a few metres into the court or, if not threatened, move both balls to a better location and set up a rush.\n\nAn extreme example would be with the opponents in corners 2 & 4. You could just set your rush, perhaps hiding behind a hoop. Better, would be to take-off from partner to one of the corner balls and leave it in court, where sensibly the opponent has to play it next turn, whilst retreating back to partner and setting a useful rush. In other circumstances you could get both of the opponent's balls away from the boundaries before returning to partner.\n\nHoop Attempt Placing Partner Near Boundary\n\nIf you rush your partner far from your hoop, there are attacking and defensive options. You could take-off for hoop position, run the hoop and possibly be rewarded with a rush of sorts (figure A below). A more defensive option would be to roll to hoop running position, but placing your reception ball near the boundary (figure B)\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nDefensive play\n(A) Yellow for hoop 1 has rushed red far from the hoop. A long take-off for hoop position fails, leaving yellow to join up with red in the middle of the court, take hoop position or shoot off distant from red.\n(B) Instead of a take-off, a defensive roll is an option.\n(C) If yellow fails to get hoop position then it can take a defensive position on red. Should yellow be able to run the hoop, red is still within hitting distance.\n\nIn the former case if you fail to get hoop position with the take-off your options are either to join up with partner in court, or shoot off to the safety of the boundary likely surrendering the inning.\n\nWith the defensive roll you are building in a fall-back plan. If you fail to get hoop running position you can play behind partner and guard the boundary (v.i.). If you do run the hoop partner is hittable but you have surrendered any useful rush.\n\nDefence at the End of a Turn\n\nWhilst there are good things to do at the end of a turn, resulting in solid leaves which yield breaks, here we solely consider the components contributing to a defensive leave.\n\nStandard Manoeuvres\n\nThese are called standard because most croquet players will do them, either intentionally or not. Not all are good moves!\n\nSingle Ball Targets\n\nIt can be expensive to give the opponent a huge target by placing your balls close together (\"leaving a pawnbrokers\").\n\nIf possible (and desirable) leave a rush directly to one of the opponent's balls, presenting a single ball target. The most reliable way to achieve this is getting your balls close together before the final stroke. Then you only need a small stroke to perfectly position the striker's ball.\n\nOften you see a player stop-shot partner to near the boundary and then play towards that ball from a few metres hoping to get an accurate position. Better, roll both balls to the boundary concentrating on the position of partner, then position the striker's ball. Even better, roll both balls to as near to their final positions as you can, and then tweak the final alignment with a short shot.\n\nWide Joins\n\nThese are a standard defensive manoeuvre used when the opponent is joined up to make it difficult for them to take-off from their partner to your balls, hit one and get an accurate rush on the other. By placing your balls sufficiently far apart on a boundary they are unlikely to get the rush, but you are threatening to hit partner next turn. They have to do something about your balls. Wide joins are great for extracting bisques from opponents. They are even better when you are at the far end of the lawn …\n\nJoin at Far End of the Lawn\n\nIt is advantageous to join up as far from your opponent as possible. It gives them a long shot at you, reducing their chance of hitting. Against a high bisquer, or under very difficult conditions, this is worth doing even if they are joined up. No one likes the very long take-off to get to you.\n\nNot Joining Up at their Hoops\n\nThe title says it all. If you are by their hoop and they hit something, you have provided them with a pioneer.\n\nHiding Behind Hoops\n\nWith a thought to not conceding a wiring lift you can reduce an opponent's options by wiring yourself from one or both of their balls. Even if you hide only one ball they have fewer options. If you give them few choices you can predict what they are going to do and design your leave accordingly. As with setting a single ball target (above) you want to roll the balls close together with partner ball reaching a wired position. A small stroke on the striker's ball then completes hiding the balls.\n\nPatently it is more difficult to hide behind a hoop if you are side on to it - it is a thin obstruction. If you have the opportunity to position an opponent's ball you can go for a 'thick' wiring or better place two hoops between you and the opponent. For example, laying up on the line between hoops 4 and 5 by the east boundary with the opponent beyond hoop 5 on the same line.\n\nAunt Emma\n\nThis is the name given to a mind numbing style of play, where a player constantly splits up the opponents and then joins up with partner, occasionally snatching a hoop. Don't do it. It might be defensive but if a competent opponent hits in, then in one turn they will make more hoops than Aunt Emma has in the last two hours. Vitriol and tactics against Aunt Emma are given in those links. Surprisingly there have been occasional B-class players who have extracted victory by boring their opponents to death by this technique.\n\nMaking Shots Unattractive\n\nDeterring a player from taking a particular shot has a couple of advantages. Firstly you limit their choice of prudent shots hence you can predict their play, e.g. which ball they are likely to play and where it will end up if they miss. Consequently you design your leave to take advantage of this. Secondly if they do take the 'unattractive' shot it is likely going to be expensive if they miss. Obviously you consider wirings, single ball targets and where the opponent may shoot when laying up.\n\nGuarding Boundaries\n\nBalls by the boundaries are defensive. If an opponents shoots at a boundary ball and misses it comes back on close to its target and can be readily roqueted next turn. There is a disincentive for shooting at balls by the boundary. Conversely a ball in the middle of the lawn is a safe target - even if you miss you will sail through to the safety of the boundary.\n\nHence when you lay up at the end of your turn you should do so close to the boundary. You are guarding the boundary.\n\nVery Close to the Boundary\n\nThere are subtleties with where you place your balls as indicated in the following diagram.\n\n\t\n\nGuarding boundaries. Grey line is yardline. Blue misses red and yellow.\n\na. Very Close to the Boundary. If blue shoots say at yellow and misses, yellow then roquets blue. Yellow has little space to play a stroke to get blue far into court whilst still getting the rush again on red. Blue will not end up far from the boundary. It will be more difficult to pick up blue subsequently and incorporate it into a break.\n\nb. Guarding Off the Boundary. Yellow is perhaps 1 m off the yardline. It can turn around and roquet blue. Subsequently blue can be sent some way into the court with a stop-shot whilst regaining the rush on red.\n\nc. Guarding with Balls very Close Together. Here you are giving away a rush to anywhere on the lawn if blue hits. However, the balls are so close together that blue has to leave one ball behind, almost on the yard line. This results in a 3-ball break at most. If blue misses, the same applies for yellow - a 3-ball break. Useful for a stronger player against players with bisques. The stronger player will be better at 3-ball breaks.\n\nd. Guarding Corners. Yellow can turn around and hit blue. Blue can be sent well into court with a stop-shot whilst regaining the rush on red.\n\nClearly balls very close to the boundary (figure a) limit how far you can spit an opposition ball into the court. You may need to revisit that ball a couple more times during your break, levering it out a little more each time, before it can be incorporated into your break. Balls very close to the boundary are an order of magnitude safer than joining up in the middle of the lawn.\n\nGuarding Off the Boundary\n\nGuarding the boundary with your back ball a couple of metres off the boundary (figure b) gives you more scope to turn around, roquet the opponent's ball and stop-shot it significantly into the court whilst getting a rush on partner. This means you can gain use of the opposition ball in your break quickly.\n\nGuarding with Balls very Close Together\n\nIf you are a competent player or want to extract bisques then joining up on the boundary with your balls very close together (say 15 cm) can be effective (figure c). The key is that should a shot be taken at those balls, one ball is going to be left on the boundary, whoever gets the innings. This forces a player into a 3-ball break, which is fine for a competent player, but will extract bisques from a weaker one.\n\nGuarding Corners\n\nGuarding corners is an extension of guarding off the boundary. In the latter case if an opponent's ball is also near that boundary it can shoot along the boundary and end up far from your balls. If however you guard a corner (figure d) any shot taken at you will come back onto the yard line very close to the corner spot and your balls.\n\nLurking\n\nPlacing your ball adjacent to a hoop the opponent is about to make can be effective against C-class players and above. Say they are for hoop 2, you could shoot into corner 2 and hope that they might break down giving you a short hit-in; this puts them under pressure. Alternatively it could cause them to adopt a non-optimal line of play lowering their chances of making the hoop. Another position to lurk is level with the hoop on the nearest boundary to the side of the hoop. If they choose to use you to make the hoop, then coming from the side of the hoop is a difficult approach.\n\nA more experienced opponent will not be that bothered and simply try a stop-shot approach on the hoop from your lurking position.\n\nWhich Ball will they Play?\n\nThe Tea Ladies leave\n\nWhilst similar to making shots unattractive above, the following topics deal with attempting to dictate which ball an opponent should play with and the shot taken. This is highly significant in at least two situations. In doubles if there is a weak opponent partner you would contrive to make them the obvious person to play at the start of their next turn. You are trying to shut out the better player. Secondly in singles or doubles you might want to make their forward ball play since it has fewer hoops to make.\n\nLimiting Choices\n\nLimiting the possible shots that an opponent can take many forms - not necessarily as sanitised as the Tea Ladies leave (opposite). Normally a player has six shots to consider, excluding bisque play, at the start of a turn: one of my balls at the other three and my other ball at the other three. Reducing the opponent's choices allows you to predict their likely shot with more certainty. Hiding behind hoops, wirings, single ball targets and guarding the boundary reduces their options. Additionally leaving them a long suicide shot (miss this and I have won!) may cause them to run away and not shoot at anything.\n\nLeave a Specific Ball by your Hoop\n\nIt is tactically wise to move your ball if it is a pioneer on the opponent's hoop. The opponent has the same thoughts. Consequently leave the opponent's ball you want them to play as your pioneer (figure 1 below).\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n1. Leave a specific ball by your hoop. Start of red and yellow's turn. Red is on blue's hoop so it is good that it moves. You are forcing red to play. (A sensible place for red to go would be near corner 4.)\n\n\t\n\n2. Lurk behind a ball likely to be missed. Blue in play. If blue shoots to 'a', red will likely shoot through yellow. Were yellow to shoot at red it would feed blue should it miss. Similarly playing blue to 'b' would encourage yellow to shoot at red.\n\n\t\n\n3. Leave a rush to where a miss will send a ball. Blue and black laying up. Blue and black leave a rush to near where red would end up should it miss yellow. If the trap is spotted it encourages yellow to play at red.\n\nLurk Behind a Ball Likely to be Missed\n\nIn some circumstances you can make a shot with one of the opponent's balls very unattractive, encouraging them to play with the other. In figure 2 above you can position blue to encourage the opponent to play with red or yellow.\n\nLeave a Rush to where a Miss will Send a Ball\n\nYou can set a trap by leaving a rush to where you expect the opponent to miss to as in figure 3.\n\nThere will be other examples which I have omitted. If you have suggestions of common defensive tactics I'd be glad to hear of them. Clearly wildly hypothetical situations or those requiring two balls to be in the jaws of different hoops are of less use.\n\nAuthor: Dr Ian Plummer\nAll rights reserved © 2022-2024\n\n\nUpdated 25.xii.24\nAbout, Webmaster\t\nwww.oxfordcroquet.com/coach/defence/index.asp\non www.oxfordcroquet.com\n\t\nHits: 3042\n\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFront Page\nWhat's New\nHow to Play\nEquipment\nLaws\nRefereeing\nRankings\nTournaments\nTechnical\nLawn Care\nCroquet Clubs\nClub Management\nHealth & Safety\nPromoting Croquet\nHistory\nContacts & Links\nFAQ\nMiscellany\nAdverts",

There is little on this site or elsewhere* on consolidating your position or inhibiting the opponent's options and opportunities, or both.\n      Your target is to make it difficult and/or expensive for the opponent to play certain shots; you try to dictate their play. When it is your turn and you do not have the innings, you need to weigh up the gains and risks of each shot you could take. If you miss that shot are you giving them an easy 4-ball break? Should you not take the shot but play a strategic safety shot to a beneficial point on the boundary and wait for later opportunities?\n      In the last century players were much more defensive, for example shooting off into corners ('finessing') or leaving wired rushes at the end of a turn. I recall being told \"a good leave is worth a break\". With improved lawns and equipment, however, a ball in a corner is little challenge to an expert player.\n      Naturally, with any list of rules there are always exceptions. And bisques stir things up!\n      \n        * As an example the CA's Manual for Coaches only discusses defensive openings. Wylie's Expert Croquet Tactics and the recent Beyond Expert Croquet Tactics (buy) predominately consider Advanced leaves.\n      \n      Gains and Risks\n      In croquet there is a constant balance between gains and risks - how likely am I to hit, what do I gain if I hit and what do I give away if I miss? The same applies when considering the opponent: how have they been playing, what is their hitting distance, are they good at long take-offs or rushing? Additionally bisques come into the reckoning. \n      Can you attempt a manoeuvre but still have a safe retreat path if it does not work? \n      It goes without saying that you should avoid 'weak manoeuvres', e.g. joining up by the opponent's hoop or in the middle of the lawn. These are covered in an accompanying article, \"Rules of Thumb\". \n      Defence During Play\n      The examples below apply mainly to the start of and during your turn. What to do at the end is considered in the next section.\n      Half Measures are Seldom Effective\n      Say you have no safe shot at any of the other balls on the lawn, and you want to 'bury' a ball so that it is of no use to the opponent, be defensive. Get the ball well out of play on the boundary likely near a corner and behind their break so it is difficult to winkle out. When being defensive - be defensive! \n      Shooting Through to the Boundary\n      When attempting to hit-in at an in-court ball ensure that your ball will reach the boundary behind it. Boundaries are defensive - if you are near a boundary, an opponent gives a lot away if they shoot at you and miss. Additionally it is much more difficult getting any sort of rush on that ball and hence it is more difficult for the opponent to  build a break easily.\n      Playing Behind their Break\n      Behind their break means that, say the opposition is on hoop two then near corner one is behind their break. Generally you pick up boundary balls and incorporate them into a break as you pass them. For example you would pick up a ball in corner 1 before hoop 5. By playing behind the break you delay the pick up causing them to play at most a 3-ball break for a number of hoops. \n      Clearly there are times when the opponent's clip positions limit the options.\n      At the start of a turn, you should consider shots where your ball would end up behind the opponent's break (not necessarily aiming at another ball). In other circumstances you would factor where a ball would end up if you shoot at an in-court ball. If there is a choice, all things being equal, the shot where a miss deposits your ball behind their break has an advantage.\n      Shoot Outside the Corner\n      Burying a ball in a corner is generally safe against players with a handicap greater than ~6. Against better to elite players there is a risk of them getting a cannon. A 3-ball cannon usefully gets all the balls into the lawn and, hopefully, a break started. It is relatively easy to get a corner cannon since a ball rushed anywhere between the corner pegs, a wide target (1.29 m or 51\"), comes back in contact with the corner ball and a 3-ball group is made.\n      When playing against good players it can be prudent to aim just outside the corner to prevent an easy opportunity to make a cannon. Conversely giving a weak player a cannon is likely to result in opportunities for you when it fails.\n      Do You Want to Take Partner into Lawn?\n      If there is a poor chance of getting a break going it can be imprudent to rush your partner fully into the court. It may end up exposed, where the opponent has a safe shot through it to the safety of a boundary. It may be better to bring it a few metres into the court or, if not threatened, move both balls to a better location and set up a rush.\n      An extreme example would be with the opponents in corners 2 & 4. You could just set your rush, perhaps hiding behind a hoop. Better, would be to take-off from partner to one of the corner balls and leave it in court, where sensibly the opponent has to play it next turn, whilst retreating back to partner and setting a useful rush. In other circumstances you could get both of the opponent's balls away from the boundaries before returning to partner.\n      Hoop Attempt Placing Partner Near Boundary\n      If you rush your partner far from your hoop, there are attacking and defensive options. You could take-off for hoop position, run the hoop and possibly be rewarded with a rush of sorts (figure A below). A more defensive option would be to roll to hoop running position, but placing your reception ball near the boundary (figure B)\n      \n        \n          \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          Defensive play\n              (A) Yellow for hoop 1 has rushed red far from the hoop. A long take-off for hoop position fails, leaving yellow to join up with red in the middle of the court, take hoop position or shoot off distant from red.\n              (B) Instead of a take-off, a defensive roll is an option. \n              (C) If yellow fails to get hoop position then it can take a defensive position on red. Should yellow be able to run the hoop, red is still within hitting distance.\n        \n      \n      In the former case if you fail to get hoop position with the take-off your options are either to join up with partner in court, or shoot off to the safety of the boundary likely surrendering the inning.\n      With the defensive roll you are building in a fall-back plan. If you fail to get hoop running position you can play behind partner and guard the boundary (v.i.). If you do run the hoop partner is hittable but you have surrendered any useful rush.\n      Defence at the End of a Turn \n      Whilst there are good things to do at the end of a turn, resulting in solid leaves which yield breaks, here we solely consider the components contributing to a defensive leave.\n      Standard Manoeuvres\n      These are called standard because most croquet players will do them, either intentionally or not. Not all are good moves! \n      Single Ball Targets\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n      It can be expensive to give the opponent a huge target by placing your balls  close together (\"leaving a pawnbrokers\"). \n      If possible (and desirable) leave a rush directly to one of the opponent's balls, presenting a single ball target. The most reliable way to achieve this is  getting your balls close together before the final stroke. Then you only need a small stroke to perfectly position the striker's ball. \n      Often you see a player stop-shot partner to near the boundary and then play towards that ball from a few metres hoping to get an accurate position. Better, roll both balls to the boundary concentrating on the position of partner, then position the striker's ball. Even better, roll both balls to as near to their final positions as you can, and then tweak the final alignment with a short shot.\n      Wide Joins\n      These are a standard defensive manoeuvre used when the opponent is joined up to make it difficult for them to take-off from their partner to your balls, hit one and get an accurate rush on the other. By placing your balls sufficiently far apart on a boundary they are unlikely to get the rush, but you are threatening to hit partner next turn. They have to do something about your balls. Wide joins are great for extracting bisques from opponents. They are even better when you are at the far end of the lawn …\n      Join at Far End of the Lawn\n      It is advantageous to join up as far from your opponent as possible. It gives them a long shot at you, reducing their chance of hitting. Against a high bisquer, or under very difficult conditions, this is worth doing even if they are joined up. No one likes the very long take-off to get to you.\n      Not Joining Up at their Hoops\n      The title says it all. If you are by their hoop and they hit something, you have provided them with a pioneer.\n      Hiding Behind Hoops\n      With a thought to not conceding a wiring lift you can reduce an opponent's options by wiring yourself from one or both of their balls. Even if you hide only one ball they have fewer options. If you give them few choices you can predict what they are going to do and design your leave accordingly. As with setting a single ball target (above) you want to roll the balls close together with partner ball reaching a wired position. A small stroke on the striker's ball then completes hiding the balls.\n      Patently it is more difficult to hide behind a hoop if you are side on to it - it is a thin obstruction. If you have the opportunity to position an opponent's ball you can go for a 'thick' wiring or better place two hoops between you and the opponent. For example, laying up on the line between hoops 4 and 5 by the east boundary with the opponent beyond hoop 5 on the same line.\n      Aunt Emma \n      This is the name given to a mind numbing style of play, where a player constantly splits up the opponents and then joins up with partner, occasionally snatching a hoop. Don't do it. It might be defensive but if a competent opponent hits in, then in one turn they will make more hoops than Aunt Emma has in the last two hours. Vitriol and tactics against Aunt Emma are given in those links. Surprisingly there have been occasional B-class players who have extracted victory by boring their opponents to death by this technique.\n      Making Shots Unattractive \n      Deterring a player from taking a particular shot has a couple of advantages. Firstly you limit their choice of prudent shots hence you can predict their play, e.g. which ball they are likely to play and where it will end up if they miss. Consequently you design your leave to take advantage of this. Secondly if they do take the 'unattractive' shot it is likely going to be expensive if they miss.    Obviously you consider wirings, single ball targets and where the opponent may shoot when laying up.\n      Guarding Boundaries\n      Balls by the boundaries are defensive. If an opponents shoots at a boundary ball and misses it comes back on close to its target and can  be readily roqueted next turn. There is a disincentive for shooting at balls by the boundary. Conversely a ball in the middle of the lawn is a safe target - even if you miss you will sail through to the safety of the boundary.\n      Hence when you lay up at the end of your turn you should do so close to the boundary. You are guarding the boundary. \n      Very Close to the Boundary\n      There are subtleties with where you place your balls as indicated in the following diagram.\n      \n        \n          \n          Guarding boundaries. Grey line is yardline. Blue misses red and yellow.\n             a. Very Close to the Boundary. If blue shoots say at yellow and misses, yellow then roquets \n              blue. Yellow has little space to play a stroke to get blue far into court whilst still getting the rush again on red. Blue will not end up far from the boundary. It will be more difficult to pick up blue subsequently and incorporate it into a break.\n             b. Guarding Off the Boundary. Yellow is perhaps 1 m off the yardline. It can turn around and roquet blue. Subsequently blue can be sent some way into the court with a stop-shot whilst regaining the rush on red.\n             c. Guarding with Balls very Close Together. Here you are giving away a rush to anywhere on the lawn if blue hits. However, the balls are so close together that blue has to leave one ball behind, almost on the yard line. This results in a 3-ball break at most. If blue misses, the same applies for yellow - a 3-ball break. Useful for a stronger player against players with bisques. The stronger player will be better at 3-ball breaks.\n             d. Guarding Corners. Yellow can turn around and hit blue. Blue can be sent well into court with a stop-shot \n              whilst regaining the rush on red.\n        \n      \n      Clearly balls very close to the boundary (figure a) limit how far you can spit an opposition ball into the court. You may need to revisit that ball a couple more times during your break, levering it out a little more each time, before it can be incorporated into your break. Balls very close to the boundary are an order of magnitude safer than joining up in the middle of the lawn. \n      Guarding Off the Boundary\n      Guarding the boundary with your back ball a couple of metres off the boundary (figure b) gives you more scope to turn around, roquet the opponent's ball and stop-shot it significantly into the court whilst getting a rush on partner. This means you can gain use of the opposition ball in your break quickly.\n      Guarding with Balls very Close Together\n      If you are a competent player or want to extract bisques then joining up on the boundary with your balls very close together (say 15 cm) can be effective (figure c). The key is that should a shot be taken at those balls, one ball is going to be left on the boundary, whoever gets the innings. This forces a player into a 3-ball break, which is fine for a competent player, but will extract bisques from a weaker one.\n      Guarding Corners\n      Guarding corners is an extension of guarding off the boundary. In the latter case if an opponent's ball is also near that boundary it can shoot along the boundary and end up far from your balls. If however you guard a corner (figure d) any shot taken at you will come back onto the yard line very close to the corner spot and your balls.\n      Lurking\n      Placing your ball adjacent to a hoop the opponent is about to make can be effective against C-class players and above. Say they are for hoop 2, you could shoot into corner 2 and hope that they might break down giving you a short hit-in; this puts them under pressure. Alternatively it could cause them to adopt a non-optimal line of play lowering their chances of making the hoop. Another position to lurk is level with the hoop on the nearest boundary to the side of the hoop. If they choose to use you to make the hoop, then coming from the side of the hoop is a difficult approach.\n      A more experienced opponent will not be that bothered and simply try a stop-shot approach on the hoop from your lurking position.\n      Which Ball will they Play?\n      \n        \n          \n            The Tea Ladies leave\n        \n      \n      Whilst similar to making shots unattractive above, the following topics deal with attempting to dictate which ball an opponent should play with and the shot taken. This is highly significant in at least two situations. In doubles if there is a weak opponent partner you would contrive to make them the obvious person to play at the start of their next turn. You are trying to shut out the better player. Secondly in singles or doubles you might want to make their forward ball play since it has fewer hoops to make.\n      Limiting Choices \n      Limiting the possible shots that an opponent can take many forms - not necessarily as sanitised as the Tea Ladies leave (opposite). Normally a player has six shots to consider, excluding bisque play, at the start of a turn: one of my balls at the other three and my other ball at the other three. Reducing the opponent's choices allows you to predict their likely shot with more certainty. Hiding behind hoops, wirings, single ball targets and guarding the boundary reduces their options. Additionally leaving them a long suicide shot (miss this and I have won!) may cause them to run away and not shoot at anything.\n      Leave a Specific Ball by your Hoop \n      It is tactically wise to move your ball if it is a pioneer on the opponent's hoop. The opponent has the same thoughts. Consequently leave the opponent's ball you want them to play as your pioneer (figure 1 below). \n      \n        \n          \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          1. Leave a specific ball by your hoop. Start of red and yellow's turn. Red is on blue's hoop so it is good that it moves. You are forcing red to play. (A sensible place for red to go would be near corner 4.)\n          2. Lurk behind a ball likely to be missed. Blue in play. If blue shoots to 'a', red will likely shoot through yellow. Were yellow to shoot at red it would feed blue should it miss. Similarly playing blue to 'b' would encourage yellow to shoot at red.\n          3. Leave a rush to where a miss will send a ball. Blue and black laying up. Blue and black leave a rush to near where red would end up should it miss yellow. If the trap is spotted it encourages yellow to play at red.\n        \n      \n      Lurk Behind a Ball Likely to be Missed\n      In some circumstances you can make a shot with one of the opponent's balls very unattractive, encouraging them to play with the other. In figure 2 above you can position blue to encourage the opponent to play with red or yellow.\n      Leave a Rush to where a Miss will Send a Ball\n      You can set a trap by leaving a rush to where you expect the opponent to miss to as in figure 3.\n      \n      There will be other examples which I have omitted. If you have suggestions of common defensive tactics I'd be glad to hear of them. Clearly wildly hypothetical situations or those requiring two balls to be in the jaws of different hoops are of less use. \n      \n      Author:  Dr Ian Plummer \n      All rights reserved © 2022-2024 \n      \n      \n\n\n  \n    \n      Updated 25.xii.24\n      \n      About, Webmaster\n    \n        www.oxfordcroquet.com/coach/defence/index.asp\n        \n        on www.oxfordcroquet.com\n    Hits: 3042",
